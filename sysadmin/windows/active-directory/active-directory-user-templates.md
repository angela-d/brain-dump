# Create a User Template in Active Directory
Streamline user creation with templates.

In the tree pane of Active Directory:
- Right-click **Users**
- Select New > User

A 'New Object - User' window will appear.

- Pre-fill data that you'd like to reuse for this user type and enter a First & Last name descriptive of the content

Example:
- First: IT, Last: Group, Username: itgroup

Click next

- Enter a password
- Un-tick *User must change password at next logon*
- **Tick** *Account is disabled*

Finish

On the overview, you'll now see **IT Group** with a down arrow over the user icon, indicating the account is disabled.

## Adding a User with the User/Group Template
- Right-click on the user object you want to utilize (ie. **IT Group**)
- Select Copy
- Populate details for the new user
- **Un-tick** *Account is disabled*

Done
