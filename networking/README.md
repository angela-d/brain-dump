# Linux-based Router Firmware

Notes for DD-WRT and OpenWRT router firmware.

DD-WRT
- [Hosts](dd-wrt.md) - Network-based ad and malware filtering, without additional hardware
- [Wifi VLAN setup](dd-wrt-vlan.md) - Guest wifi network setup

OpenWRT
- [Wired switchport VLAN](openwrt-switchport-vlan.md) - Isolate untrusted wired devices
- [Wifi VLAN](openwrt-wifi-vlan.md) - Isolate untrusted wifi devices / guest network

Post Installation
- [Additional Security](additional-security.md) - Even with previous hardening, some stuff slips through the cracks
