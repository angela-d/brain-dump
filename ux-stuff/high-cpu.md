# High CPU Usage in GNU/Linux Distros
My laptops (plural) would sweat when visiting certain poorly made, Javascript-heavy sites like ebay or amazon on both Firefox and Waterfox browsers.

Super easy fix:
- [CPU Power Extension](https://github.com/martin31821/cpupower) from Gnome Software Center

Caveat is if the profile is too low, the site will crawl and responsiveness of Ajax-based forms may be glitchy, but the site also won't chew on all available CPU.

The tradeoff is minimal, compared to the annoyance of the fan kicking in when visiting such websites.
