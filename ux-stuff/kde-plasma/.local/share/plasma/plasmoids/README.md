# Custom Weather Widget Icons 
Plasmoid weather widgets:
- [Wunderground PWS Widget](https://store.kde.org/p/1411968/)
- [Wunderground/Weather PWS Widget Extended Version](https://store.kde.org/p/1756638/)


I added/replaced the default icons for the icon theme I'm using on KDE: [Cyberpunk Technotronic](https://www.pling.com/p/1999292) by [dreifacherspass](https://github.com/dreifacherspass)

I lay no claim to the awesome work of dreifacherspass - simply leaving these here in case anyone else is also a user of this icon theme and would like to use these icons in their weather widget.
