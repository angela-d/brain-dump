# Mouse Scroller Stopped Working
The center mouse scroller stopped working or worked sporadically.

To test, run:
```bash
xev | grep button
```

An Event Tester window will appear, click inside of it and trigger a scrolling event.

Test:
- right click
- left click
- center scroller

If the mouse scroller is broken, you won't see any output when triggering a mouse event, in the terminal.

## Other Troubleshooting
Take compressed air and clean the crevices of the mouse.  Also reseat the battery.
