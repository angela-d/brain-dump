# Upgrading Grafana while Retaining Data
How I upgrade Grafana.  My development/testing environment runs Grafana on a Debian 10 desktop.  The live/production version runs on Windows Server 2016.

## Pre-upgrade Prep
Read the release note(s) on the [downloads](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) page to see if there's any ominous warnings of things that might break my install
- [Backup your database](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/upgrading/) (location varies depending on database engine your install uses)

## Linux
1. Simply [download the .deb](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux)
2. Follow the instructions (though I prefer to use `apt install` instead of `dpkg -i`)
3.
```bash
service grafana-server restart
```
4. Done.

## Windows
Note that if you fail to stop the Grafana server before upgrading, you'll probably get a prompt to reboot the *entire server* to finish the upgrade!

1. Make a copy of `C:\Program Files\GrafanaLabs\grafana\data\plugins` on the desktop
2. Go to **Services** (services.msc) > Grafana > right-click > Stop
3. [Download the .msi installer](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=windows) > run
4. Go to **Services** (services.msc) > Grafana > right-click > Start
5. Done.
